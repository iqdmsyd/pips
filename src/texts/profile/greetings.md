Assalamu’alaikum Wr. Wb.

Praise and gratitude we pray to the presence of Allah SWT who has bestowed endless blessings on all of us. Sholawat and greetings may be poured out to our lord, the great Prophet Muhammad SAW who has brought this ummah from darkness to a message of truth that is brightly lit. As the head of the Social Sciences Education Study Program, FPIPS, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, I am very happy and proudly welcome the presence of this website of the Social Sciences Education Study Program.

Through this website, it is hoped that academic and general information regarding the Social Sciences Education Study Program can be accessed especially by the academic community within the Indonesian Education University, as well as the general public in general. Indeed, in the midst of globalization and the current rapid flow of information, UPI as a university that puts forward the motto "Leading and Outstanding" must be proactive in responding to the challenges of the era. The Social Science Education Study Program as part of the community also tries to take part in the effort to realize the intended goals through the development of this website.

It is a pleasure for me, if the public can accept the presence of our website as a vehicle for the establishment of a communication link between the campus world and its partners, especially education practitioners in schools. Thus, it is hoped that there will be a synchronization between the theoretical level in higher education and the practical level in the field. Of course, as something that develops, our website is not free from various shortcomings. We are very grateful and welcome with open arms if there are constructive criticisms and suggestions for the progress of all of us.

We do not forget to express our gratitude and congratulations to all those who with their determination and hard work were able to bring this website of the Social Sciences Education Study Program to our midst. 

Wassallamu’alaikum Wr Wb
