Social Studies Education Study Program has very adequate facilities and infrastructure such as lecture rooms, laboratories, meeting rooms, lecturer work rooms, micro teaching, lecturer work rooms and others in order to create a conducive academic atmosphere in lectures. In addition, it is also supported by the availability of teaching materials, lesson plans, research-based learning activities and community service. To achieve the above targets, the Study Program is equipped with management units that support the development of Study Programs such as the Quality Assurance, Curriculum, Student Affairs, Finance, Thesis Writing Development Team (TPPS), Research and Community Service (PPM), the Laboratory, and Social Science Pedagogy online journal. The managers of the unit/field of activity are appointed based on an agreement in the Study Program meeting which is attended by the Study Program academic community.

Through the leadership of a Head of Study Program under the Dean of the FPIPS Faculty, Social Studies Education Study Program can be managed properly. Management is carried out based on the applicable regulations at UPI by referring to the Academic Guidelines, Lecturer Code of Ethics, UPI Statutes, University Strategic Plans, 5 Faculties and Social Studies Education Study Programs. The management system also coordinates with the Faculty according to the procedures in ISO which are owned by FPIPS. To maintain the quality of education, Study Program is bound by the Quality Assurance owned by UPI. Supported by a curriculum that refers to the UPI Curriculum Guidelines and the Re-Design of Teacher Professional Education, the Social Studies Education Study Program has utilized digital-based information systems such as internet networks through the ICT Directorate and computer networks connected via Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wi-fi.

Through this information system, the study program's academic activities are very well organized, such as information on RPS, class schedules, and student grades that can be accessed online. This information is needed for the process of academic guidance by academic supervisors (PA Lecturers) to students. Besides the advantages in using this information system, there are still weaknesses such as the delay of lecturers in submitting test scores online. In order to improve the qualifications of educators, the Study Program includes lecturers in seminars, training, and workshops at various domestic and foreign institutions. Finally, in 2017 the Study Program sent 1 lecturer to take a short course at Leiden University in the Netherlands for 1 month. In addition, lecturers participate in various trainings including indexed journal writing training, English language training for young lecturers at the Language Center, as well as workshops on writing teaching materials.

During the last three years, the academic work of lecturers derived from research and academic thoughts in the form of books, teaching materials, and papers has been the academic strength of this study program. The works of social studies lecturers are not only used by students of the S1, S2 and S3 Study Programs at UPI, but also by the wider community, both at the university and school levels (SD, SMP and SMA). In addition, their academic works are also published in various national and international journals. Lecturers' academic works are also published in an online journal owned by this study program, namely the Social Sciences Pedagogy Journal which can be downloaded from various parts of the world. The publication of journals containing the results of research by lecturers and students is used by lecturers in the learning process with the aim of turning learning in this study program into research based-teaching, although only a small number of lecturers use it. The study program's financial management system is designed through the Annual Budget Work Plan (RKAT).

Based on the RKAT that has been prepared, the Study Program organizes various activities freely while still referring to university guidelines. Various Study Program activities such as the preparation of lecture modules, RPS, research and community service, as well as student guidance are supported by very adequate funds so that they can help create a conducive academic atmosphere. In order to improve quality, Study Program organizes research and community service activities in collaboration between lecturers and students. The results of the research that has been carried out by the lecturers have increased very well both in quality and quantity published in accredited and indexed scientific journals. Community service is carried out by the Study Program in collaboration with BEM HIMA PIPS, also under the coordination of LPPM in the field of social studies learning development and social studies teacher professional training in several SMP/MTs. As evidence of the quality of the PIPS study program, it can be seen from the output of graduates, the study program gave birth to alumni spread across various schools and government institutions throughout Indonesia. Most of the alumni were immediately absorbed as teaching staff in public and private SMP/MTs schools. PIPS Study Program alumni do not only work in the field of education but in various fields, including the field of service, social affairs (NGOs), banking, and the field of business or self-employment. Among them are listed as Civil Servants of P4TK Semarang, PNS of Social Service, Permanent Lecturers at State University of Malang and private LPTKs in various Indonesian countries, as well as employees in various government and private institutions.
