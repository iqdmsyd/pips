1. Tracer Study
Tracer Study is one of the methods used by several universities, especially in Indonesia, to obtain feedback from alumni. Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia also conducts a tracer study process for alumni by filling out online questionnaires. The evaluation is also aimed at alumni to get input on the benefits of learning in their job search process and their current job. Evaluation is done through [UPI's CDC website](https://cdc.upi.edu/).

The results of the evaluation, information and recommendations are used to improve the curriculum and/or learning activities.
