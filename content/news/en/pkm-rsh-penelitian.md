The FPIPS Social Sciences Education Study Program Student Creativity Program Team conducted research on the Effect of Work-Study Conflict on Psychological Well-Being Experienced by UPI Students.

This research is the fruit of an idea obtained from the PKM-RSH UPI team which consists of Muhamad Wildan, a student from the Social Sciences Education study program in 2017 as well as a team leader, then Nurdiansyah Ramadhan, a student from the Social Sciences Education study program 2017, and Rifa Madyana Putri, a student from the Psychology study program. 2019 under the guidance of Mina Holilah, M.Pd.

The increasing number of students who choose to work while they are still studying in college is the beginning of this research. Our team has the idea that it is not easy for a student whose every activity needs to follow a series of lecture agendas and then is also busy with all the activities where he works so that it can cause conflicts that occur in the individual. Therefore, by looking at a new perspective from a psychological point of view, we want to know whether there is an influence given by the dual role conflict between being a student and being a worker on the individual's psychological well-being.

In the research conducted by our team that received PKM funding, we studied students who had conflicts regarding the division of roles as students and workers by distributing questionnaires to students at UPI who met the criteria according to our team's research.

According to the team, this research can provide an overview of the psychological well-being of students at UPI who experience dual role conflicts, namely work-study conflict. Overall, it is known that work-study conflict and psychological well-being can influence each other where students who have high role conflict will cause low psychological well-being and vice versa. Through this research, the team can provide several forms of optimizing psychological well-being so that even if someone has a low psychological well-being, students can still optimize their psychological well-being well.
